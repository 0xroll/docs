# Abstractions

#### Abstractions/table views <a id="Abstractionstable-views"></a>

These are the cleanest and easiest to use tables on Dune. We have abstractions for dex trades in the `dex.trades` table.

Together with various teams and community members weâ€™ve created table views that make the blockchain data even easier to work with. This typically entails removing decimals for ETH and token transfers, adding human readable symbols, joining relevant tables together, adding USD value of events and more.

You can always see the underlying tables derived directly from the blockchain if you need more details or are curious about how the views are created: [check out our Github](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions), you can even do a pull request to create your own abstractions.
