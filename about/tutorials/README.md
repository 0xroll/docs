## What do you need to know?

#### PostgreSQL

Dune runs on PostgreSQL 12.2, a powerful, open source object-relational database system.   
This Database System is widely used across almost all walks of life and you can find many non Dune specific documentation about it. This often times helps with answering query related questions since most answers can easily be found in the internet. The official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/index.html) is quite helpful as well. 

#### Ethereum Virtual Machine data

The data you will find on chain and therefore in Dune's databases is in many ways connected to understanding how the Ethereum Virtual Machine works as a whole and then in more specific terms understanding how the specific smart contracts work. Unfortunately there really isn't one great resource we can point you to currently as each smart contract has it's own rules. We have written up a few words on this in our [Section "decoded data"](../../data-tables/data-tables/decoded-data.md).

#### Business Understanding

This is something that might come as a surprise to some of you, but actually understanding what kinds of data is interesting for your project or topic is a fundamental part of becoming a great wizard.   
  
Ask yourself: **What Data is interesting and needed for my project to make better decisions ?**

There is a thousand ways to go about finding what metrics are interesting to your project, but talking to the community of the project or the founders usually yields good results.



### General PostgreSQL Tutorials

To be a successful Dune Wizard you need to have a good understanding of PostgreSQL to be able to query data from our database.

We have compiled a few resources that we think are helpful in your journey to becoming a Dune Wizard.

###  Dune specific Tutorials

Dune has a YouTube channel on which we try to educate people on our platform, this is probably the best resource available at the moment. You can find the relevant Videos in the section ["Video Series"](video-series.md).

Some of our Community Members have produced great tutorials for Dune:
