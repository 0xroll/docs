!!! Tip 
    1. You can specify the `performance` level of executions (see example in [execute query id](../execute-queries/execute-query-id.md)).

    2. If you don't need the most up to date data and just want to query for most recently refreshed results of a query, check out the [get latest results](../execute-queries/latest-results.md) endpoint.
