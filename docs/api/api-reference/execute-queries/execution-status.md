## Check Execution Status FAQ

### What is the difference between the states “Executing” and “Pending”?

Pending means, the execution is waiting for an available execution connection slot.
Executing means the query is currently executing against the database.

Here is a list of all Status Codes for reference.

   - QUERY_STATE_PENDING  - query execution is waiting for execution slot
   - QUERY_STATE_EXECUTING - query is executing
   - QUERY_STATE_FAILED - execution failed
   - QUERY_STATE_COMPLETED - execution completed successfully
   - QUERY_STATE_CANCELLED - execution cancelled by user
   - QUERY_STATE_EXPIRED - query execution expired, result no longer available
