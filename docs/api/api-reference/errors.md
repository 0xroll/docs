title: Errors Codes
description: Here's how to handle errors that may come up when working with the Dune API.
---

Dune uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided. Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Dune's servers (these are rare).

## Common Error Code Summary
| Method      | Description                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`       | Invalid request                                               |
| `402`       | Reached maximum number of private queries                     |
| `403`       | Not allowed to create or update this query                    |
| `404`       | Query not found, or itâ€™s private and belongs to somebody else |
| `409`       | Query was updated in the meantime (this is currently never returned, but might be in the future if we add the version parameter or a nonce to the request) |

## Invalid API Key

### Response Object

```
 {'error': 'invalid API Key'}
```

#### Checks
 
  -  Make sure that you are passing your API key to our endpoint *in a header*. See the section on [Authentication](../api-reference/authentication.md) for how to do that, and our [quick start guides](../quick-start/api-py.md) for specific language examples.
  - If you are already passing the API key in an header, make sure that it is correctly entered.


## An Internal Error Occurred

### Response Object

```
 {'error': 'An internal error occurred'}
```
#### Checks

  - If you are using one of our GET endpoints, ensure that the `query_id` you have entered is correct.
  - If you are using one of our POST endpoints, ensure that the `execution_id` you obtained from your GET endpoint has been correctly passed on to your POST endpoint.
