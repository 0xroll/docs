### Execution and Results Flow

Going through these endpoints will teach you how to run an execution and grab it's results. You can specify the `performance` level of executions (see example in [execute query id](../api-reference/execute-query-id.md)).

<div class="cards grid" markdown>
- [Authentication](../api-reference/authentication.md)
- [Execute Query ID](../api-reference/execute-query-id.md)
- [Execution Status](../api-reference/execution-status.md)
- [Execution Results](../api-reference/execution-results.md)
- [Latest Results](../api-reference/latest_results.md)
- [Cancel Execution](../api-reference/cancel-execution.md)
</div>

You will likely need to reference the common [error codes](../api-reference/errors.md) too.

### Latest Results Endpoint

If you don't need the most up to date data and just want to query for most recently refreshed results of a query, check out the [get latest results](../api-reference/latest_results.md) endpoint.
