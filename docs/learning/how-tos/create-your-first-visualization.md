After executing a query, you'll be presented with a set of results. The next logical step? Visualize that data for a clearer insight. This guide will show you how to layer a combined bar and line chart atop the data from [Create your first query](./create-your-first-visualization.md).

Here is a visual click-through version if you are more of a visual learner. Below is a written version. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px); height: 0;"><iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/w7bs2kM4P4Kg42PONF84?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;"></iframe></div>

1. **Begin Visualization**: Click on "New Visualization" and select your desired chart type. For this tutorial, initiate with a bar chart and click "Add Visualization."

2. **Display Data**: By default, the chart will showcase `monthly_gas_spent`. To augment the depth of insights, include the `cumulative_gas_spent` column.

3. **Adjust Chart Type**: Transition the representation of `cumulative_gas_spent` from a bar to a line chart, offering a more nuanced view.

4. **Fine-tune Your Chart**: Customize the display values for a polished look. For detailed formatting guidance, [refer to this resource](../../app/visualizations/charts-graphs.md#visualization-configuration-options).
