**The Dune platform is your key to accessing blockchain data!**  

  

The Dune App consists of these components:
#### [Queries](queries/index.md)
The Query Editor is where you can write SQL queries to explore blockchain data. This docs section describes the functional elements of the Query Editor, to learn how to write queries, see [the query section](../query/index.md). 


#### [Visualizations](visualizations/index.md) 
Visualizations make your data come to life! You can create Visualizations from any results of a query.

#### [Dashboards](dashboards.md)
Dashboards are a collection of Visualizations and text that you can share with the world. You can create Dashboards out of any Visualizations you have created.

#### [Decoding](decoding-contracts.md)
Decoding is a feature that allows you to submit contracts for decoding. This is useful if you want to decode events or transactions that are not decoded already.

#### [Teams](teams.md)
Working with a team? You can create a team and invite your teammates to collaborate on queries, visualizations, and dashboards.

#### [Embeds](embeds.md)
Embeds allow you to embed your Visualizations on your website, blog, twitter, or anywhere else you want to share your data.
