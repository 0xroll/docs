Queries can now be set to run on a schedule to keep dashboards up to date more reliably! Weâ€™ll also be adding additional functionality such as webhooks, alerts, and updating materialized views using query schedules.

!!!Caveat

- Scheduling isnâ€™t available on queries with params
- When queries are archived or when the ownership changes (e.g. query migrated), the query schedule is removed
- There are currently no notifications in place for if a scheduled query fails

### How to schedule a query

To schedule a query, click the scheduler icon on the query editor page.

Youâ€™ll be prompted to set a refresh schedule and an execution tier. Scheduled queries can **only be scheduled on medium and large query engines, which uses credits**.
An estimated monthly credits consumption for this query scheduling will be shown to you, alongside with a monthly estimated quota. They will be adjusted based on the frequency and execution tier you choose.

Your query will be run once saved. You can see a scheduler frequency next to the scheduler icon.
