## Counters

Counters are a great way to provide your audience with immediate "on a glance" stats.

#### Counter options

In this section you can define what kind of data the counter should display:

=== "Title"

    * The Title will appear in all instances of this graph prominently at the top
    * If left blank the Query name will be the only thing that is left standing

=== "Column"

    * In this field you can define which column the counter should show.

=== "Row"

    * This field can be used to define which row of the underlying data table you want displayed e.g. row 1
    * Usually this requires you to sort or limit your Query results in order for row 1 to show the wanted results.

***

#### Formatting

This section is where you can adjust how your numerical data is displayed.

=== "Prefix"

    * This field allows you to define a prefix for your counter value.
    * e.g.: `$`, `€`, `Ξ`, `฿`

=== "Suffix"

    * This field allows you to define a suffix for your counter value.

=== "Label"

    * This field allows you to define a label for your counter value.
    * The label will appear beneath the counter value as text.

=== "Decimals"

    * In this field you can choose how many decimals you want displayed for your counter
    * This is currently limited to 3 decimal places.
