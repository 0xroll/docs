## Understanding Spell Models

If you are just looking to understand the basic models [from the Github Repo](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook), read through the [example model walkthroughs of transfers and balances of ERC20 tokens](Example%20Spell%20Models/index.md)

!!! note "Spellbook Model Creation Runs on Spark SQL"
       Spellbook Spells are available on Dune V2, queryable from both Spark SQL and Dune SQL [V2 Query Engines](../query/index.md). For now, Spells will continue to be written in Spark SQL and querying them with Dune SQL will require small syntax changes. While the changes needed to make Spells Dune SQL native are small, we want to make sure Dune SQL is rock solid before we implement them!
